Ctags "tags" files provide a treasure trove of information on the locations of symbols in a project. Since ruby is such a strongly opinionated language, we can also make some educated guesses in order to get even more useful information out of it.

For now, the project only reads the tags and provides a very simple interface to them, but in the future, more stuff may be added.
